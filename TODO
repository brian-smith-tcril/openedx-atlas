checking in a todo list for now

since we moved to gengetoptions, it'll be good for the CI to understand that
the general idea will be to keep the generated script in the repo, so we'll just
want the CI to run gengetoptions on the existing script, and then compare it to the
committed one and ensure they're the same.
things to keep in mind
* getoptions version

releases
* probably still worth doing them, can be simplified to just pulling the file and adding it to the release

shellspec tests
* do all the things the python ones did
* figure out good mocking (maybe split up methods a bit more)
